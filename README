## Part 1

1. Connect table up to mocked API in Concerns/concernApi.ts & use that instead of dummy data
  - Mocked API has delay and may error
2. Connect the resolve button to the mocked resolve API, remove the row when the API request is resolved
3. Add conditional styling to make severity text bold and red when severity is severe
